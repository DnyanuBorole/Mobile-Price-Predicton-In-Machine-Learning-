# Mobile-Price-Predicton-In-Machine-Learning-
This project is done using machine learning,Basically I use three algorithm in this 
i.e SVM,Naive Bayes Classifier, and FLDA. Accuracy for this implementation is 95.009%.
First the doctor give 13 medical prescription values as a input the it will be automatically diplayed the result as a positive or negative using machine learning.
I use Training and Testing dataset here for prediction purpose
. for installlation of this project requires installments:

pip install Python==3.6.7
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
